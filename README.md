HandyHub is a service-providing application that connects users with trusted professionals for various needs such as home maintenance, cleaning, repair, and personal services. Inspired by platforms like UrbanClap, HandyHub simplifies the process of finding and booking reliable service providers.

One of the unique features of HandyHub is its loyalty token system, which rewards users with tokens on every booking. These tokens can later be redeemed for discounts on future services, making HandyHub both convenient and cost-effective.
